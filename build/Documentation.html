<h1>Pliable Form Documentation</h1>
<h2>Set Up</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Install PliableForm.umb package.</li>
    <li>Use the Pliable Form Document Type in your content tree.</li>
    <li>Assign fields to it by adding new content nodes below the form.</li>
    <li>Create a template and assign the form to it. This is optional because you can just use the macro to link to the form.</li>
    <li>Use a Pliable Form macro to add to the template you created.</li>
    <li>Edit the Pliable Form dictionary items to change mail settings.</li>
    <li>Add smtp mail server settings to the web.config.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: This form does not need an actual form tag to run and should not conflict with any addition forms on the page. Additional work is needed if you wish to use two Pliable Forms on the same page as the field IDs will conflict.</p>
<h2>Document Types</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pliable Form</strong> - Start with this Document Type to begin creating your form. This includes many settings about the form. From this content node you should be able to create content nodes below to add form fields. Feel free to add you own tabs and properties to this.
        <ul>
            <li><em>Form Content</em> - This is displayed with the form and is replaced when the form is replaced.</li>
            <li><em>Submit Button Text</em> - This string populates the input button or anchor tag that submits the form.</li>
            <li><em>Loading Image</em> - This is the image that is displayed while the Ajax call is waiting for the server's response.</li>
            <li><em>Success Content</em> - This is shown if the form has successfully been emailed.</li>
            <li><em>Error Content</em> - This is shown if there was an error in trying to send the email.</li>
            <li><em>To Address</em> - This overwrites the default To Address set in the Dictionary or Web.config. Mail to multiple recipients by separating each value with a semi-colon.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
	<p><em>* Tokens can be used to add field values inside your autoresponder message. Just use curly brackets around the field node names. (e.g. Thank you {First Name} {Last Name}!)</em></p>
    <li><strong>Pliable Fields</strong> - This is just a Master Document Type to hold all of the form field Document Types.</li>

<h2>Dictionary Items/Settings</h2>
<p>All Dictionary Items can be replaced by keys of the same name placed in the appSettings of the Web.config</p>

    <li><strong>PliableForm.enableSsl</strong> - <em>bool</em> - "true" or "false"</li>
    <li><strong>PliableForm.fromAddress</strong> - <em>string</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Macros/XSLTs</h2>
<p>Add a Pliable Form Macro to your template to run a Pliable Form XSLT that formats the form. You can use these macros inside the editor to call the form from another page. The XSLT is the key to formatting your form to your website design. As a rule, don't change the tag IDs as the field ID, name and value are used by the javascript. The class 'pSubmit' is intended to be used on an input button or an anchor tag. Feel free to change what you want here as this is the "pliableness" of the package.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pliable Form</strong> - Basic xslt that separates each field in paragraph tags.
		<ul>
			<li><em>Form Node Id</em> - Use this when the Pliable Form node is in a different location. Leave this blank if the current page is the Pliable Form.</li>
			<li><em>Include jQuery</em> - Check this parameter if you don't already have jQuery on the page.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li><strong>Pliable Form table</strong> - Basic xslt that formats the fields within a table.
		<ul>
			<li><em>Form Node Id</em> - Use this when the Pliable Form node is in a different location. Leave this blank if the current page is the Pliable Form.</li>
			<li><em>Include jQuery</em> - Check this parameter if you don't already have jQuery on the page.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p><strong>PliableForm.js</strong> - This contains the code responsible for submitting the form and sending the information by AJAX to the PliableSender.asmx/PliableForm.dll to format and send the email. This also handles any validation that is set on the field. The same validation is not done in the code behind of PliableSender.asmx; by default, .NET should handle malicious requests sent through AJAX form. Feel free to edit the javascript as you feel comfortable.</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><strong>PliableForm.css</strong> - This optional file is only included to help you understand some of the classes that put on the fields by the xslt and javascript.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>.pText</em> - Default class on the input type text and textarea fields.</li>
    <li><em>.pSelect</em> - Default class on the select fields.</li>
    <li><em>.pCheckbox</em> - Default class on the checkbox fields.</li>
    <li><em>.pRadio</em> - Default class on the radio button fields.</li>
    <li><em>.pCheckboxList</em> - Default class on the surrounding span of the label and checkbox fields.</li>
    <li><em>.pHighlightText</em> - Appended class if text field doesn't validate.</li>
    <li><em>.pHighlightSelect</em> - Appended class if the select field doesn't validate.</li>
    <li><em>.pHighlightRadioList</em> - Appended class to a parent element of the radio buttons if the radio list doesn't validate.</li>
    <li><em>.pErrorMessage</em> - Default class on the span containing the validation error message.</li>
    <li><em>.defaultValue</em> - Appended class if the input type text field or textarea contains the default string.</li>
    <li><em>.userValue</em> - Appended class if the default value of an input type text field or textarea is erased.</li>
</ul>
